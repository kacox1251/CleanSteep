# CleanSteep


## Description 

Clean steep will allow a user to create lists of rock climbing routes.

A user can sign in or create a new account which will then take them to the search page to search for routes around their desired US city. The search will show routes, their difficulty, as well as an image of the route.

If they save any routes, they will be added to their "Saved Routes" page, and they will be displayed on the left of the page. The user can mark any saved routes as completed, which will display a a graphical breakdown of the difficulty of the routes, as well as a list of the completed routes below that. They can also see a graph displaying the difficulties and list of routes they have not completed yet. A user can also rate their favorite routes on a 5 star rating basis, or delete routes they no longer wish to save.

## User Story 
As a climber I want to track my rock climbing trips so I can observe my progress and plan for future trips.


## Future Development 
    * Add comments to your saved routes.
    * Limit searches by route difficulty, plus other search filters.
    * Add user connectivity.
    * Add timestamp/date for when route was completed.
    * Filter saved routes.
